# Inefficient Recursive Fibonacci
This repository demonstrates an inefficient recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Python and shows a more efficient solution using dynamic programming.
The `bug.py` file contains the inefficient recursive code, while `bugSolution.py` offers an optimized alternative.
The original recursive approach suffers from overlapping subproblems, leading to exponential time complexity.  The solution addresses this by storing and reusing previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.
